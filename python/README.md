# Snake Game Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Snake game implemented using Python with `pygame` and a web-based frontend. The user can navigate to the `index.html` page to start the game, which will run the Python Snake game application.

The repository contains the following:
- A Python implementation of the Snake game using `pygame`.
- A simple web interface (`index.html`) that allows the user to start the game.
- A backend server script (`server.py`) to handle the communication between the web page and the Python game.

└───server.py         # The Flask server script to handle game execution
```

## Requirements

To run the game, you need to have Python and `pygame` installed on your machine. You will also need `Flask` for running the backend server.

Install the necessary packages by running:

```sh
pip install pygame flask
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd games.com
   ```

2. **Start the Flask Server**

   Run the Flask server by executing `server.py`:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Open the Webpage**

   Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will see a button labeled "Start Game".

4. **Start the Game**

   Click the "Start Game" button. This will send a request to the Flask server, which will then run the `snake_game.py` Python script to start the game.

## Files Explanation

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file which serves as the user interface.
- **`style.css`**: Contains the styling for the webpage to make it visually appealing.
- **`script.js`**: Handles the click event for the "Start Game" button and communicates with the Flask server.
- **`snake_game.py`**: The Python script that implements the Snake game using `pygame`.
- **`server.py`**: The backend server implemented using Flask to handle requests from the web page and run the game.

## Gameplay Instructions

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
- The objective is to collect the green food and grow the snake without hitting the boundaries or colliding with itself.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` 2.6.1
- `Flask` 2.0.1 or newer

## Future Enhancements
- Add more levels or difficulties to the Snake game.
- Implement a scoring system on the web page.
- Host the entire application online so users can play directly from their browsers.
